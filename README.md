# AirBnB_Case_Study_Data-Storytelling

# Problem background
Suppose that you are working as a data analyst at Airbnb. For the past few months, Airbnb has seen a major decline in revenue. Now that the restrictions have started lifting and people have started to travel more, Airbnb wants to make sure that it is fully prepared for this change.

The different leaders at Airbnb want to understand some important insights based on various attributes in the dataset so as to increase the revenue such as -

- Which type of hosts to acquire more and where?
- The categorisation of customers based on their preferences.
    - What are the neighbourhoods they need to target?
    - What is the pricing ranges preferred by customers?
    - The various kinds of properties that exist w.r.t. customer preferences.
    - Adjustments in the existing properties to make it more customer-oriented.
- What are the most popular localities and properties in New York currently?
- How to get unpopular properties more traction? and so on...

# End Objective
To prepare for the next best steps that Airbnb needs to take as a business, you have been asked to analyse a dataset consisting of various Airbnb listings in New York. Based on this analysis, you need to give two presentations to the following groups.

- Presentation - I
    - Data Analysis Managers: These people manage the data analysts directly for processes and their technical expertise is basic.
    - Lead Data Analyst: The lead data analyst looks after the entire team of data and business analysts and is technically sound.
- Presentation - II
    - Head of Acquisitions and Operations, NYC: This head looks after all the property and host acquisitions and operations. Acquisition of the best properties, price negotiation, and negotiating the services the properties offer falls under the purview of this role.
    - Head of User Experience, NYC: The head of user experience looks after the customer preferences and also handles the properties listed on the website and the Airbnb app. Basically, the head of user experience tries to optimise the order of property listing in certain neighbourhoods and cities in order to get every property the optimal amount of traction.

# Recommendations to increase revenue:
- Entire apt and Private rooms are major source of revenues. Emphasize on privacy on booking platform to improve conversion rate of entire apt or private room
- Incorporating attractive incentive scheme for hosts based on availability and ratings could influence hosts to take ownership for maintaining availability and ratings on higher side.
- Appointing executives to personally meet property hosts with zero reviewed property or very low availability and try to overcome the pain points for optimal resource management. Priority should be given to location wise popular areas. E.g. Private rooms from Brooklyn, Entire apt from
Manhattan etc.
- Create some sort of interaction between the Top 5 hosts to share their experience with the rest of the community for better improvement and value-generating ideas.
- Incorporating a tier system for hosts having considerable number of listings, e.g. platinum, gold, silver etc. and additional benefits should be passed on based on the tier.
- Referral scheme should be launched in order to acquire more hosts. The referral bonus should be higher where market penetration is low, e.g. Staten Island, Bronx.
